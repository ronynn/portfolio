"Lost time is never found again," so said Ben Franklin, and he was onto something. Time, it's a slippery thing, slipping through our fingers like water through a sieve. We're always chasing after it, trying to catch up, but somehow it's never quite within reach. We fill our days with noise and distraction, the important things getting lost in the shuffle.

But here's the thing: I've been thinking. Maybe there's a better way. Maybe we can tame the beast, make time work for us instead of against us. Here's what I've found:

There's something special about the crack of dawn, when the world's still half-asleep and the day's possibilities stretch out before you like a blank canvas. That's when the real magic happens, when you can sink your teeth into the meaty tasks that matter most. Four hours of focused work in the morning can beat eight hours of half-hearted effort any day of the week. And when you knock off at noon, you can kick back and enjoy the sweet taste of accomplishment, knowing you've earned it fair and square.

Save the night for reflection: When the sun sets and the world grows quiet, that's when it's time to take stock of the day's victories and defeats. It's not about cramming in last-minute studying or trying to learn something new. No, sir, it's about revisiting what you've already learned, reinforcing those neural pathways, and tucking them in nice and snug for the night. Anything else is just asking for trouble, a surefire recipe for a restless sleep and a groggy morning after.

In the inundation of information that characterizes our modern existence, we find ourselves awash in a sea of facts and figures, each vying for our attention. It's akin to a buffet spread before us, yet not all are worthy of consumption. So why squander our intellectual appetite on trivialities that fail to nourish our minds or advance our pursuits? Let us adopt a discerning palate, focusing solely on the substantive material that aligns with our objectives and aspirations. It's not about amassing encyclopedic knowledge; rather, it's about cultivating a depth of understanding in the areas that truly matter.

Consider the classroom setting, where the drone of a lecturer's voice can lull one into a state of mental lethargy. Tempting though it may be to mentally check out, this time is invaluable—a fleeting opportunity to absorb knowledge like a sponge. Let us seize the moment, engaging actively in discussions, posing thoughtful inquiries, and diligently recording insights.

Now, about those dreadfully dull classes where the teacher's voice is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Trapped in a room with someone who's about as inspiring as a wet rag. And if asking questions or having discussions is discouraged? Well, good luck with that. Some teachers are about as open to dialogue as a brick wall.

But fear not, my friend. There's always a silver lining, even in the darkest of clouds. If the class is a lost cause, why not use the time to sharpen your multitasking skills? Take notes with one hand and take the time to catch up with distant relatives over chat with the other. Or better yet, use the opportunity to practice your poker face.

And as for those precious lunch breaks? Well, let's just say they're a welcome respite from the monotony of the morning. So go ahead, treat yourself to a feast fit for a king. You've earned it, after all, if only for surviving another day in the academic trenches. Let it serve as a gratifying reward for our intellectual exertions, a culinary indulgence savored in the wake of a morning well spent. This is a valuable insight I have received much later in life.


Exercise, that invigorating pursuit which invigorates both body and mind, need not be confined to a single, exhaustive session. Instead, let us integrate it seamlessly into our daily routine, punctuating periods of activity with moments of physical exertion. Whether it be a brief stretch, a leisurely stroll, or a spontaneous burst of movement, let us embrace the rhythmic cadence of our bodies, ensuring a constant flow of vitality and energy.

Ever find yourself ensnared in the stagnation of a familiar environment, your thoughts mired in complacency? It may be time to seek refuge in a new locale, to disrupt the status quo and awaken dormant creativity. Who knows what inspiration may be unearthed amidst unfamiliar surroundings? Let us venture forth, casting off the shackles of routine in pursuit of newfound perspective and insight.

Procrastination, that insidious foe which saps our productivity and sows the seeds of inertia, demands a resolute countermeasure. Break down tasks into manageable segments, commencing with the simplest and gradually scaling upwards. Set a timer, if necessary, and plunge headlong into the fray. Once momentum is gained, the barriers of procrastination crumble in the face of determined action.

And finally, let us not overlook the necessity of rest and recuperation in our ceaseless pursuit of excellence. Designate a day—a degeneration day, if you will—devoted solely to leisure and leisure alone. Indulge in diversions and distractions, unencumbered by the weight of obligation. Yet let us exercise restraint, reserving such indulgences for rare occasions, lest they become the norm rather than the exception.

Here's the lowdown on how I'm planning to tackle memorization of my notes:

Priming: Before diving into new material, I'll give my brain a little warm-up by exposing myself to related information. It's like prepping the canvas before painting—a crucial step to activating prior knowledge and forging connections between what I already know and what I'm about to learn. Take biology, for instance. Before hitting the books, I'll watch a video or read an article on the topic. It's all about priming the pump and getting my brain in gear.

Active Recall: No more passive absorption for me. I'm all about flexing those memory muscles with active recall. After studying a chapter on history, for instance, I'll close the book and put myself to the test. Can I recall the main facts and dates without peeking? It's like a mental game of hide-and-seek, forcing me to retrieve information from memory and cementing it for the long haul.

Repetitions: Forget the cram-and-forget approach. I'm embracing spaced repetitions to solidify my memory. After studying a chapter on math, I'll revisit it at regular intervals over time—today, tomorrow, next week, you name it. It's like watering a plant; consistent care leads to growth and permanence.

Interleaving: No more marathon study sessions on a single subject. I'm mixing things up to keep my brain on its toes. Instead of drilling down on one topic, I'll switch between subjects every 15-30 minutes. It's like a mental workout, challenging my brain and making it more adaptable and nimble.

And let's not forget practice testing, it isn't just a check-in—it's a crucial tool for tracking progress and reinforcing learning. It's like giving myself a reality check, ensuring that the knowledge sticks and I'm on the right track.

These strategies may not be rocket science, but they demand discipline and commitment. If I stick with them, I'm betting on seeing some serious gains in my academic performance and personal growth.
