I recently finished a project that I want to tell you about. It’s a game I made for a friend of mine, for his birthday. He has a sharp wit and a good sense of humor, and I wanted to give him something that would suit his taste. So, I made a game called “Aesthetics Over Plot.”

The game is simple and funny. The premise is this: you’re at a party trying to land a job through networking, but you’re not very good with words. The game doesn’t take itself seriously, and neither should the player. It’s meant to be a source of amusement, a way to laugh and pass the time.

Some of the highlights include being interviewed by a donkey, which is actually quite cool, and convincing a mind-reading cactus to employ you as a biologist. There are other absurd and humorous scenarios, each designed to entertain and amuse.

I gave the game to my friend as a gift. He played it and laughed, enjoying the wackiness and absurdity of it all. He told me it was one of the best presents he’d ever received, though he said it with a grin that told me he might be exaggerating. Still, I could see he was delighted, and that made me happy.

Creating this game taught me something, too. I learned more about making games, and I pushed my creativity further than I had before. It was a good project, both for me and for my friend.

Now, I want to share this game with you. You can find it on my website, under the name “Aesthetics Over Plot.” It’s free to play, and it runs right in your browser. It’s a simple game, but I hope it will entertain you and make you laugh.

Thank you for listening to my story. I hope you enjoy the game, and I hope you remember to celebrate your friends’ birthdays. Show them your love and gratitude. After all, that’s what life is about.
