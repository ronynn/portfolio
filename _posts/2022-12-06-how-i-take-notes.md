Let me tell you how I’m making notes these days. This isn’t an essay; it’s just my current hack at it. I figured out the best way to do it a couple of days ago, but naturally, I didn’t write it down, so now we’re stuck with this makeshift method. Welcome to my chaotic mind.

For nonfiction stuff, I just dive right in on the first read. Skip lines like it’s a hopscotch game, slap sticky notes everywhere—walls, fridge, cat if it stays still long enough. Memorizing the index is key because it’s like having a mental hallway to all the rooms full of data. Then I make notes on some app that autosaves (because we all know how reliable my memory is). I shorten the content in sequence, then memorize that too. After all that, I whip up some flowcharts to look all organized and impressive.

When it comes to news and general knowledge, I arrange everything by date and then memorize it. You might ask, “Why dates?” Well, right now, I think of it as a web of facts that needs updates, and remembering when I first learned something helps me access those updates faster. Plus, it sounds fancy.

For writing by hand, I use bits of paper or a notepad. Revising learned stuff is key; kinesthetic memory, baby! Keeps the brain juices flowing. I keep these bits of paper somewhat organized. The same goes for math—memorize the formulas, practice the questions, keep the papers close. I’ve got a system, even if it looks like chaos.

Using a journal? Oh, I’ve got that covered. I jot down places I go, keep track of regular visits like I’m running a detective agency. I note interesting conversations and business cards from people I meet. I also record what books and papers I read each day, because why not?

And those brilliant thoughts that hit you when you’re out and about? Bits of paper are a nightmare unless you’ve got a bag. A pocket notepad with a pencil or your phone works better. If I want to capture a view to sketch later, I use my memory as a canvas and jot down the details. It’s like painting without the mess.

I’m sure I’ve scribbled this stuff down elsewhere too. So many experiments, so much time invested, yet here I am, still not sure how to make notes or do a lot of other things. I mean, I’ve got a clue, but I’m just trying to rearrange it all properly. The eternal struggle, right?
