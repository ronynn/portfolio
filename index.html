                <h3>About</h3>
                Welcome to my Homepage! I’m passionate about developing apps and
                games, and you’ll find a range of my projects showcased here.
                From practical applications to engaging games, I’m constantly
                experimenting with new ideas and refining my skills. <br />
                <br />
                I regularly update my blog, where I delve into the art of
                overthinking mundane topics from an analytical
                perspective—offering insights and unique viewpoints on everyday
                subjects. In addition to coding, I enjoy sketching and exploring
                new libraries and technologies in my spare time. <br />
                <br />
                If you’re interested in my work or have any questions, feel free
                to reach out. Thank you for visiting!

                        <p>
                            <strong>Ronynn Weather:</strong> Ever wondered if
                            it’s going to rain cats and dogs? Check out Ronynn
                            Weather to get the latest weather updates without
                            the furry confusion.
                        </p>
                    </a>
                    I chose to create a glassmorphism-based weather app to offer
                    a sleek, modern, and visually appealing interface. The
                    frosted glass effect enhances readability by providing a
                    blurred background that maintains focus on essential weather
                    information. This design choice not only improves user
                    experience but also gives the app a contemporary, elegant
                    look.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Cat-generator:</strong> When you need a cat
                            but don't have the time or patience for one, let the
                            Cat-generator bring you some virtual feline fun.
                        </p>
                    </a>
                    A glassmorphism-based design merged functionality with
                    aesthetics. The translucent glass effect provides a clean
                    and stylish appearance while ensuring the calculator remains
                    user-friendly. This design approach emphasizes simplicity
                    and elegance, making everyday calculations feel more
                    engaging and visually pleasing.

                            <strong>GlassCalc:</strong> Need to do some
                            calculations but want a touch of elegance? GlassCalc
                            has you covered with its sleek, transparent design.
                        </p>
                    </a>
                    Developing a cat generator app that can later transform into
                    a live wallpaper leverages the universal appeal of cats and
                    the dynamic capabilities of Android. By starting with a fun,
                    customizable cat generator, users can enjoy personalized
                    content, and the added option for a live wallpaper allows
                    for a seamless extension into a dynamic, interactive home
                    screen experience.

                <summary>What code editors do you use?</summary>
                <p>
                    I use Acode on Android for its versatility and Notepad++ on
                    PC for its lightweight and efficient editing capabilities.
                    Both tools help me stay productive and manage my code
                    effectively.

                <summary>What game engines would you recommend?</summary>
                <p>
                    I recommend choosing game engines with fewer dependencies
                    and ones that fit your specific needs. For 2D physics, Box2D
                    is quite sufficient. For 3D projects, I’ve used A-Frame and
                    found it useful, though it’s essential to evaluate libraries
                    based on the project requirements.

                <summary>How many hours do you code in a week?</summary>
                <p>
                    The amount of time I spend coding varies depending on
                    whether I have a project idea and how much I already know
                    about building it. A significant portion of my time is often
                    spent discussing design aspects with friends, which helps
                    refine the final outcome.

                <summary>What is your typing speed?</summary>
                <p>
                    My highest typing speed is around 90 words per minute,
                    though I generally type at about 60 words per minute.

                <summary>What are your thoughts on Rust?</summary>
                <p>
                    Rust is a useful language depending on the use case. Since
                    my projects are oriented towards graphical content, I
                    primarily use the JavaScript ecosystem, which suits my needs
                    well. However, I’ve learned Rust out of curiosity and
                    appreciated its thought processes, though I found the build
                    times to be somewhat cumbersome.
