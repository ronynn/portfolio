I regularly update my blog, where I delve into the art of
overthinking mundane topics from an analytical
perspective—offering insights and unique viewpoints on everyday
subjects. In addition to coding, I enjoy sketching and exploring
new libraries and technologies in my spare time.

If you’re interested in my work or have any questions, feel free
to reach out. Thank you for visiting!
